            <p>In the Spring semester of 2017, I convinced most of the active members of Computer Science House to buy a differential drive robot one of our members had built in his free time. I have set out on the endevour of getting it to map out floor using hector SLAM. On top of that, I am trying to imlement a way for the robot to wander around in a partially "known" map.</p> 
            <p>The goal would be to have the wandering explore fringes of the map in hopes of expanding it. The current candidate is the hector navigation stack using the exploration node. See the image below for Kudos in its current state.</p>

            <p>Before the robot was bought by Computer Science House, it only had remote control functionality via a wireless Xbox controller. After it was purchased, I outfitted the robot with a neato XV11 Lidar, a webcam, and a Raspberry Pi 3. I setup hector SLAM on the Raspberry Pi using the LaserScan data from the XV11 Lidar. I setup the ros visualization tool Rviz to receive the map topic. I drove the robot around floor to generate a map and localize within it. I encountered a huge latency issue as the Raspberry Pi was unable to perform SLAM in a timely fasion. A new aproach was required.</p>

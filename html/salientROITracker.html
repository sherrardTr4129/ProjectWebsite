	<p>This project was performed as part of my research efforts for my robotics master's program. I sought to combine two existing algorithms to detect motion of salient regions of interest (ROIs). The first algorithm implemented was a saliency map computation algorithm developed by Sebastian Montabone, et. al in their work <i>Human detection using a mobile platform and novel features derived from a visual saliency mechanism</i>. The second algorithm developed here was a motion detection algorithm using an implementation of an algorithm developed by Jong-Hann Jean et. al in their work <i>Robust Visual Servo Control of a Mobile Robot for Object Tracking Using Shape Parameters</i>. Please see the sections below for a more in depth view of the overall developed algorithm and a demo video. </p>

	<p>As previously mentioned, the first portion of this algorithm was implemented to compute a saliency map from a given webcam frame. This was done by first moving the image to the spatial frequency domain. From here, a log scale version of the spectral image was computed. This was then used to compute a spectral residue image. This spectral residue image was then moved back to the spatial image domain and was converted to a standard int8 OpenCV image for operations later in the image processing pipeline. A flowchart representation of this portion of the algorithm can be seen in the image below.</p>
